    "**Data Persistence:** Flask can integrate with databases, allowing you to store the scraped data persistently. This is useful when you want to build an application that continuously collects data from websites over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asynchronous Scraping:** Flask can be used in combination with asynchronous libraries like aiohttp or grequests to perform parallel or asynchronous scraping, making the process more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authentication and Security:** If the web scraping application requires authentication to access certain websites or APIs, Flask can handle user authentication and security features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deployment:** Flask is lightweight and easy to deploy, making it suitable for hosting the web scraping application on various platforms, including cloud servers or containerized environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scraping Management:** Flask can be used to manage and monitor the scraping process. For instance, it can be used to schedule periodic scraping tasks or set up scraping rules.\n",
